/* Function to draw an antialiased line from (X0,Y0) to (X1,Y1), using an
 * antialiasing approach published by Xiaolin Wu in the July 1991 issue of
 * Computer Graphics. Requires that the palette be set up so that there
 * are NumLevels intensity levels of the desired drawing color, starting at
 * color BaseColor (100% intensity) and followed by (NumLevels-1) levels of
 * evenly decreasing intensity, with color (BaseColor+NumLevels-1) being 0%
 * intensity of the desired drawing color (black). This code is suitable for
 * use at screen resolutions, with lines typically no more than 1K long; for
 * longer lines, 32-bit error arithmetic must be used to avoid problems with
 * fixed-point inaccuracy. No clipping is performed in DrawWuLine; it must be
 * performed either at a higher level or in the DrawPixel function.
 * Tested with Borland C++ 3.0 in C compilation mode and the small model.
